# Chowder 
Decentralized storage platform to store content on-chain with proof-of-location validation. This platform enables any user to anonymously (via crypto wallet) upload images, gifs and text into Arweave to be permanently stored and display their past postings on-chain.

## Objective
Decentralized storage enables individuals to store content permentantly and anonymously. Why does this matter? Around the world, there are numerous cases of authoritarian control over entire populations directing the ability to have free speech and own freedom.

This platform addresses:
1. Individuals to upload images and text to Arweave using Bundlr
2. Confirm proof-of-location. Validation that an individual is located in the region from where they are sharing images from (timing can be confirmed via the transactions on-chain)
